This is my family's apartment.
The apartment has two bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.
Three people live in apartment: my mom, my dad and my grandma.

So, Li, this is your family's new house?
Yes! Welcome, Peter. This is our living room.
Nice. And you have three bedrooms?
Yes, this bedroom is my husband's and mine.
Okay, and this blue bedroom - is this your son's bedroom?
Yes, that's Bill's bedroom.
Whose bedroom is this?
Oh, my husband's parents are here for two weeks.
Wow.
Yes. That bedroom is theirs.

Hey, Eric, I have a new house!
That's great, Mona! Where is it?
It's on the Green Street, next to the park and the United Bank.
Sounds good, what's it like?
Well, it has one bedroom and one bathroom.
Oh, is it too small for you?
Not really, but it's expensive.
Too bad.
That's okay. My husband's parents are helping us.
That's nice. Do you like the house?
Yeah, it's beautiful! The living room is painted yellow and has three big windows. And the bedroom has a balcony.
